Chess Game Go

A popular and ancient chess game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. 

Go was invented in China more than 2500 years ago.

Go has extremely simple rules but results in extremely complex strategies.

It has not been conquered by AI until the creation of AlphaGo in 2015. 

The creation of AlphaGo brings new light to this old game. 

Players benefits tremendously from its real-time win-rate and next move suggestions. 

Go is no longer a mystery black box and will gain more popularity in Enlightenment of young children.

I am teaching my daughter Pony to play this game and code this game.

We are just beginning and hope to apply AlphaGo-similar AI in it some day.
